This is the significant senior project in which I designed the electrical systems for a building which was design as part 1 of the project.

Overview
======
In the final year of the architectural eningeering program students spend a semester taking an architecture studio to design a building on a site on campus. Programing is created from the defined requirements and integrated in a creative and artistic style to form the buildings overall design. In the next semester, teams are formed to have a balance of students focusing in Construction Management, Structures, Electrical/Lighting, and HVAC design. One building is chosen by the team fro which they design the systems and the project is taken from the conceptual design phase, to the end of design development by the end of the semester. Revit was used to design the building envelope and all the systems.

Electrical Design
======
In the Conceptual Phase of the project, the planned programing of the building was used to calculate the estimated loads of each space in the building in order to select the size of the electrical system, main transformer, and the number of panels needed. The electrical and mechanical rooms were designated. In the Schematic Phase, the demand loads were calculated which informed the feeder sixing from panels and to mechanical, electrical, and lighting devices. Voltage drop calcultaions were also performed and an inverter was chosen as the backup power supply for the emergency system. At the Design Development Phase, receptacles, panels, and the interior transfomer for 480/277V to 208/120V step down were layed out and circuited. Following NEC 2017, and the electrical codes for Boulder, CO and the Universty fo Colorado, short circuit calculations were performed and the panel phases were balanced within 8%. As a team, we were aske to propose ways each system could be designed to be more energy efficient. For the electrical design, a high effciency transfrmer was selected, some of the receptacles were put on controled circuits, and the feeder was oversized from NEC requirements.
