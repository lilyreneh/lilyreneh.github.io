 Simulating Meteor Blast Wave Propagation on the Planet Mars Using Nonlinear Acoustics.

Abstract
======
 Models of the Martian atmosphere from Bass and Chambers [2001], Williams [2001]
 and Petculescu [2016] predict that it absorbs sound more than Earth’s atmosphere. The
 experiments that have been done with Ingenuity and are being done with the Persever
ance microphone will begin to confirm the accuracy of such models [Maurice et al., 2022].
 Because these models predict high sound absorption, even at short distances, only high
 amplitude, low frequency sound waves will propagate well on Mars. Meteors are an
 expected high amplitude sound source that have already been documented on Mars.
 Presented is an analysis of simulation of the infrasound signature of a meteor blast
 wave as it would be received after traveling through the Martian atmosphere. Starting
 from replicating the absorption model from Bass and Chambers, a model of the Martian
 atmosphere that includes nonlinear behavior was built up to simulate high amplitude
 sound wave propagation. This work follows a similar approach that has been used to
 validate and update models used to predict meteor blast waves in the Earth’s atmosphere
 [Edwards, 2009], [Nemec et al., 2017]. The augmented Burgers’ solver developed by
 Cleveland and Hamilton was verified for nonlinearity and absorption that describe the
 Earth’s atmosphere and then used to simulate these parameters for a model Martian
 atmosphere. A blast pulse for a meteor with a high Mach number is approximated as a
 cylindrical sound source that is propagated through a homogeneous form of the Martian
 atmosphere. The solver outputs the waveform as it would be received at a number of
 distances from the source.
 Understanding meteor blast waves on Mars will help distinguish ground excitation
 by acoustic waves and meteorite impacts from seismic waves, improving study of Mars’
 seismology [Garcia et al., 2022]. In certain situations, these sounds might be heard by
 human visitors to Mars, so understanding the sounds will enhance astronaut safety and
 well-being.
 The current model sets the stage for future validation efforts when measured data
 becomes available. In the future the model could be enhanced by utilizing a profile for
 an inhomogeneous model of the Martian atmosphere to use for the same simulations.
