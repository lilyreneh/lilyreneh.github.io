This is the final project for the optical design class. We designed, produced, and tested a luminaire reflector.

Overview
======
This design is for a horticulture lamp reflector that which directs the light in a uniform distribution on a 4’ x 4’ square 2’6” from the area to be illuminated. The important aspects of the output are the target efficiency and the ratio of maximum to minimum illuminance on the plane. A balance of a low max/min ratio and high target efficiency are sought after in order to achieve high uniformity with most of the light falling inside the 4’ x 4’ square. 
The reflector aperture is 3” wide and is 1.5” tall. It was lined with a reflective lining that has an 85% reflectance. Below is a picture of it's design in Photopia.

Prediction
======
Once the reflector was designed, the output could be predicted using ray-tracing in Photopia. The distribution on a 4' x4' square and a 8' x 8' square (the full distrubtion area of the reflector) were considered, and the effieceny with the 4'ft square was 69.1% with a max/min ratio of 2.52.

Testing
======
The tested output of the reflector was acceptable, although is did not preform as well as predicted. Loss of uniformity was the main problem which was likely caused by flaws in the smoothness of the body and the precision used to place the reflective material.
