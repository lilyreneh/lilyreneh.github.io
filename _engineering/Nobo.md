Technology systems design for North Boulder Library Branch.

Overview
======
I contributed to the telecommunications, seurity, and audio visual designs for the North Boulder Library as part of the Technology team at Integral Group. 
The programing called for ease of interenet connection throughout the site, inside and outside the building. Heatmaps were done to ensure acceptable converage with wireless access points.
There are quiet study, collabration, and meeting rooms which require integration of the audio/visual system with the lighting and shading as much of the space has ample daylight.
Security is rather simple sine the building des not many exits or need for multiple zones of access control.
