How ambient pressure changes microphone response.

Overview
======
This work was part a larger effort to use microhpones in rotorcraft windtunnel testing at low ambient pressures. Calibrations were done over the full range of the microphone frequency response 
range to understand if the ambient pressure had a signficant impact on the response. Condenser microphones are designed to have a flat response across frequencies of interest so a single calibration can be done 
before data collection which will provide a single value for voltage to pressure that can be applied in post processing. This design is done for a standard Earth atomospheric pressure which does fluctuate. 
The question asked in this research was "will a major difference in ambient pressure change this microphone response?" since the Martain atmosphere has less than 1% the ambient pressure of Earth's.
