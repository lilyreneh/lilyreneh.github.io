This is the significant senior project in which I designed the electrical systems for a building which was design as part 1 of the project.

Overview
======
In the final year of the architectural eningeering program students spend a semester taking an architecture studio to design a building on a site on campus. Programing is created from the defined requirements and integrated in a creative and artistic style to form the buildings overall design. In the next semester, teams are formed to have a balance of students focusing in Construction Management, Structures, Electrical/Lighting, and HVAC design. One building is chosen by the team fro which they design the systems and the project is taken from the conceptual design phase, to the end of design development by the end of the semester.
