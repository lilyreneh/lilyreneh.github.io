I am a Master's student studying sound propagation in Mar's astmosphere at Penn State in the Acoustics department. Previously, I worked as electrical designer and Engineer in Training. This site contains projects from my undergraduate degrees as well as personal work. I have experience in many fields pretaining to lighting and low voltage design within both the building engineering and the film production fields. When I am not working, you can find me taking a stroll with my cat in a backpack, seeking out live performances of music and theatre, watching films at an art house, or hiking and camping with friends.
