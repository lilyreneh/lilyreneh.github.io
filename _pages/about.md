I am an acoustics engineering researching new ways to reduce airframe and engine noise on commerical airplanes. Previously, I was a Master's student studying sound propagation in Mar's astmosphere at Penn State in the Acoustics department. One of my favorite professional experiences happened in the summer of 2024 when I worked as an intern with the aeromechanics branch at the NASA Ames Research center. I particpated in the design, implentation, and analysis of consdenser microphone response to extreme atmospheric pressures (specifically low pressure, like Mars!) using the Planetary Aeolian Laboratory. This site contains projects from my degrees as well as personal work. I have experience in other fields pretaining to lighting and low voltage design within both the building engineering and the film production fields. When I am not working, you can find me up in the mountains hiking or snowboarding, seeking out live performances of music and theatre, or watching films at an art house.
